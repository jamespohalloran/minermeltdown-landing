# Website background
minermeltdown.net started as a Wordpress site, but was converted to a static site to save on server costs. The site is hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). The site is used as marketing, but also hosts some assets used in the steam inventory, and game files.

The master branch doesn't do anything (I used it as a staging environment). Any changes to files in the gh-pages branch will update the live site.

### Build process
Server game files can be uploaded to (https://github.com/jamespohalloran/minermeltdown-landing/tree/gh-pages/wp-content/MinerData)

### Steam inventory files
Steam inventory images can be uploaded to (https://github.com/jamespohalloran/minermeltdown-landing/tree/gh-pages/wp-content/uploads/Miner)
